About me
-------------
I develop data-driven models for tabular and time-series data. I am interested 
in modelling water quality parameters (Antibiotic resistance genes) and pollutant 
removal efficiency from industrial wastewater using supervised machine learning.

News
----------
* My first co first-author paper, titled "Prediction and Interpretation of Antibiotic-Resistance 
Genes Occurrence at Recreational Beaches Using Machine Learning Models," has been published in JEMA.
* I have published another paper (co first-author), "Artificial Neural Networks for Insights into Adsorption Capacity 
of Industrial Dyes Using Carbon-Based Materials," in the journal Separation and Purification Technology.
* A further paper, "Adsorption of Cr(VI) Ions onto Fluorine-Free Niobium Carbide (MXene) and Machine 
Learning Prediction with High Precision," has been published in the Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering.
* I have been appointed as a Research Assistant at KAUST in the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Lab 
under the supervision of Danesh Moradigaravand.
